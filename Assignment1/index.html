        <h1>Why RSW?</h1>
        <p> The web is evolving and in order to keep your site up to date you must
            practice Responsive Web Design so that your site can be seen on 
            any device that your users might be using.  Mobile devices with their
            different sizes can make a large website very difficult to see.</p>
        <p>Making your site easily adapt to a 27&quot and a 5&quot screen can be easily
            accomplished with just a few changes to the css using media queries.  
            This will help you adapt good css styling to your site and to any screen 
            it may be viewed on.</p>

        <p>Ensure your site is properly tested on as many devices as you can manage.
            Using dev tools in browsers like Google Chrome help to ensure you reach a 
            maximum amount of devices.  It is crucial that you stick to
